# Building-KNN-from-scratch
Built K nearest neighbor algorithm from scratch and classified iris.csv (a dataset from github with 150 samples)

1) Read Iris.csv and shuffle it
2) first 100 samples for train and last 50 samples for test.
3) Run KNN algorithm without any built in.
4) How many correctly predicted?
